| Classification Type        | LDR Classification      | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Active vs Passive**      | ‚úÖ **Passive Sensor**    | It does **not require an external power source** to generate the sensing effect. |
| **Continuous vs Discrete** | ‚úÖ **Continuous Sensor** | The **resistance changes continuously** with varying light intensity. |
| **Primary vs Secondary**   | ‚úÖ **Secondary Sensor**  | Light is first converted to a change in **resistance**, which is then used in a circuit to measure voltage. |
| **Absolute vs Relative**   | ‚úÖ **Relative Sensor**   | The output **voltage depends on a reference voltage**; hence, the light level is **measured relative** to this reference. |

![image-20250409151519701](./assets/image-20250409151519701.png)

üîß **Working Principle**

- The sensor is made of **two conductive copper traces** (plates) on a PCB, forming a **capacitor**.
- The **soil acts as the dielectric material** between the plates.
- As the **moisture level in the soil increases**, the **dielectric constant** of the soil changes (water has a higher dielectric constant than dry soil).
  - ‚ûú This leads to an **increase in capacitance**.

‚ö° **Role of the 555 Timer Circuit**

> ‚è±Ô∏è **What is the Purpose of the 555 Timer in a Capacitive Moisture Sensor Circuit?**
>
> The **555 timer** isn‚Äôt measuring moisture *directly*. Instead, it‚Äôs used as a **timing and signal generator tool** to help **convert capacitance into a voltage or frequency** ‚Äî something a microcontroller can read and interpret.
>
> Here‚Äôs why it's useful:
>
> ------
>
> üß© **1. Capacitance Alone Is Hard to Measure**
>
> Capacitance changes with soil moisture, but:
>
> - Microcontrollers **cannot measure capacitance directly**.
> - They **can measure time, frequency, or voltage**.
>
> So we need a **circuit** to *convert changes in capacitance into changes in voltage or timing*. That‚Äôs where the **555 timer** comes in.
>
> ------
>
> ‚öôÔ∏è **2. 555 Timer as a Frequency Generator (Astable Mode)**
>
> In **astable mode**, the 555 timer produces a **square wave signal**, and its **frequency depends on the capacitance**:
> $$
> f = \frac{1.44}{(R_1 + 2R_2)C}
> $$
>
> - **More moisture** ‚Üí **higher capacitance (C)** ‚Üí **lower frequency**
> - **Less moisture** ‚Üí **lower capacitance** ‚Üí **higher frequency**
>
> The microcontroller then measures **pulse width or frequency**, which indirectly tells you the moisture level.
>
> ------
>
> ‚ö° **3. Alternative Use ‚Äì Voltage Measurement**
>
> <mark>This method is used here</mark>
>
> In some designs, the 555 is used to **charge the capacitor**, and the voltage across it is measured at a **fixed time**.
>
> From this formula:
> $$
> V(t) = V_{\text{max}} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)
> $$
>
> - **Wet soil** ‚Üí large $C$ ‚Üí slower charging ‚Üí **lower voltage at time $t$**
> - **Dry soil** ‚Üí small $C$ ‚Üí faster charging ‚Üí **higher voltage at time $t$**
>
> The 555 timer provides **consistent timing behavior** needed to generate that predictable response.

1. A **555 Timer IC** is often used in **astable mode** to:
   - Charge and discharge the capacitor formed by the sensor at a **constant frequency**.
2. The **voltage across the capacitor** at a specific time point reflects the **amount of moisture**:
   - Wet soil ‚Üí higher capacitance ‚Üí slower charging ‚Üí **lower voltage at fixed time**
   - Dry soil ‚Üí lower capacitance ‚Üí faster charging ‚Üí **higher voltage at fixed time**

This voltage is then:

- **Read by a microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino ADC input).
- **Mapped to moisture levels** through calibration.

üîç **Classification of the Capacitive Moisture Sensor**

| **Classification Type**    | **Sensor Classification** | **Explanation**                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Active vs Passive**      | ‚úÖ **Active Sensor**       | Requires **external power** to operate the capacitor circuit and the 555 timer. |
| **Continuous vs Discrete** | ‚úÖ **Continuous Sensor**   | Continuously varies voltage output **in real time** with changing moisture levels. |
| **Primary vs Secondary**   | ‚úÖ **Secondary Sensor**    | Measures **moisture indirectly** by sensing its effect on **capacitance**. |
| **Absolute vs Relative**   | ‚úÖ **Relative Sensor**     | Output voltage reflects moisture **relative to a reference** or a **calibration curve**. |

üß™ **Why It's Preferred Over Resistive Sensors**

- **No direct contact** with soil water ‚Üí less corrosion.
- **More durable** for long-term deployment.
- **More accurate** in varying soil types (especially if calibrated).
