### **1. General-Purpose Computers (PCs)**

PCs are designed for a wide range of tasks, such as software development, gaming, browsing, and multimedia processing. Their architecture is more complex to support multi-tasking and a variety of applications.

**PC Software and System Components:**

- **Application Software:** Runs user applications like browsers, word processors, games, and development tools.
- **Common Runtime Environment:** Supports virtual environments and desktop interfaces (e.g., Windows Explorer, macOS GUI).
- **Operating System (OS):** Handles task management, memory allocation, security, and hardware abstraction. Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **BIOS/Firmware (Basic Input/Output System):** Initializes hardware at startup and loads the OS. Helps to get rid of the difficulty of managing hardware.
- **Hardware:** Includes CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, motherboard, and peripherals.

**Key Characteristics of PCs:**

 ✔ Designed for versatility and high performance.
 ✔ Multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities.
 ✔ High processing power, memory, and storage.
 ✔ Supports heavy applications like video editing and AI modeling.

------

### **2. IoT Devices (Internet of Things)**

IoT devices are designed for specific tasks like sensor data collection, automation, and real-time operations. They operate with minimal resources and often rely on wireless communication.

**IoT Software and System Components:**

- **Application Software:** Runs lightweight programs for data collection, processing, and automation (e.g., temperature monitoring, smart locks, fitness trackers).

- **Device Libraries:** Pre-compiled code to interact with hardware (e.g., sensor drivers, communication protocols like MQTT).
  <img src="./images/image-20250304043441294.png" alt="image-20250304043441294" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- **Basic Runtime Framework:** Instead of a full OS, many IoT devices use real-time operating systems (RTOS) or firmware-based execution to manage tasks efficiently. ==This will not manage the hardware. This will only help to start the program==.

  In IoT devices, a **Basic Runtime Framework** is a lightweight software layer responsible for managing the execution of programs, handling hardware interactions, and sometimes providing minimal scheduling and memory management. It is **much simpler than a full operating system** but still offers essential functionalities for embedded systems.
  
- **Hardware:** Typically includes microcontrollers (MCUs), sensors, network modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), and actuators.

**Key Characteristics of IoT Devices:**

 ✔ Optimized for low power consumption and efficiency.
 ✔ Designed for real-time operations with minimal latency.
 ✔ Often lacks a full OS (uses firmware or RTOS).
 ✔ Smaller storage and computing power compared to PCs.
 ✔ Connects to the cloud or other devices for data exchange.

## Hardware and software interactions

![image-20250304083143993](./images/image-20250304083143993.png)

------

### **1. General-Purpose Software (PCs)**

- Hardware is **abstracted** by the **Operating System (OS)** and **firmware**.
- Provides a **virtual environment** for programmers, making hardware details invisible.
- Programs interact with "virtual" devices using high-level commands:
  - Sending an **MQTT message** without worrying about the network type.
  - Reading ASCII input from the keyboard **without knowing the keyboard layout**.
  - Printing text **without handling screen resolution**.
  - Opening files **without knowing their exact location on the disk**.

> #### 🔹 **Key Benefit**: Developers don’t need to worry about hardware details—everything is managed by the OS.

------

### **2. IoT Device Software**

- The program must manage **hardware directly**, using **low-level commands** such as:
  - **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output):** To control specific device ports.
  - **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) / DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** For analog signal processing.
  - **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):** Used to control motors, LEDs, etc.
  - **I/O Protocols (SPI, I2C, UART):** Used for **sensor communication**.
  - **Memory and Flash Management:** No virtual memory—programmers must manage storage efficiently.
- **Application software must manually handle resources**: ==sometimes with the help from a pre-written library==
  - **MQTT communication**: You need to **manually check connectivity** before sending messages.
  - **Keyboard input processing**: Raw key-switch data must be **translated into ASCII codes**.
  - **I/O operations depend on the hardware**: Unlike PCs, where printing text is abstracted, IoT devices require **specific configurations**.

> #### 🔹 **Key Challenge**: IoT developers must directly interact with hardware, requiring more **low-level                ** programming and **manual resource management**.

### 3. Key differences 

| Feature                    | General-Purpose Software (PCs)         | IoT Device Software                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Abstraction**   | OS manages hardware                    | Programmer manages hardware                 |
| **Programming Complexity** | High-level APIs simplify development   | Requires direct hardware control            |
| **Device Communication**   | Automatically handled                  | Needs manual configuration (SPI, I2C, UART) |
| **Memory Management**      | Virtual memory and OS-level management | Manual memory and flash storage management  |
| **Ease of Use**            | Easier for developers                  | Requires embedded programming knowledge     |

- **PC software is user-friendly** because the OS abstracts hardware complexities.
- **IoT software requires low-level programming** because the developer must manually control hardware.
- If you're working with IoT, you’ll often **write C or Python** for microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32, Raspberry Pi, etc.) and use **protocols like MQTT, I2C, and SPI**.

## Cross platform development

IOT can't be developed in a single platform

![image-20250304084107115](./images/image-20250304084107115.png)

#### **1. Development on a PC (Traditional Software Development)**

- Everything happens in **one environment** (coding, compiling, testing, and execution).

- Advanced debugging tools

   available:

  - **Breakpoints & stepping through code**: Allows developers to pause execution and inspect variables.
  - **Debug outputs (print statements)**: Easy to track program flow.
  - **Logging console**: Collects real-time logs for troubleshooting.
  - **Test scripts**: Automate testing.

✅ **Why it’s easy?**
 Because the **development environment and execution environment are the same**.

------

#### **2. Development on IoT Devices (Embedded Systems)**

- Development & execution occur in different environments :
  - Code is written & compiled on a PC (cross-compilation).
  - The compiled binary is deployed to the **IoT device** (like an ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or STM32).

**Challenges in IoT Development**

1. **Limited debugging tools**:
   - **No display** for direct debug output.
   - **No breakpoints or real-time stepping** (like in PC-based debugging).
   - Debugging often requires **external hardware tools** (e.g., JTAG, logic probes).
2. **Monitoring difficulties**:
   - Unlike a PC, where errors and logs appear in a console, IoT devices might require **serial debugging (UART/USB)** or logging to external files.
   - Some IoT devices have **real-time constraints**, making debugging harder.
3. **Hardware-dependent debugging**:
   - Debugging might need **oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or JTAG programmers**.
   - Debugging in low-power or networked IoT systems often requires **remote logging mechanisms**.

> <u>**How to Debug IoT Devices Efficiently?</u>**
>
> Here are **some workarounds** to make debugging easier in IoT projects:
>
> **1. Serial Debugging (UART)**
>
> - Most microcontrollers (ESP32, Arduino, STM32, etc.) support **UART-based debugging**.
>
> - Example for ESP32 using Serial Monitor:
>
>   ```cpp
>   void setup() {
>       Serial.begin(115200);  // Start serial communication
>       Serial.println("Device Started!");
>   }
>   
>   void loop() {
>       Serial.println("Reading sensor data...");
>       delay(1000);
>   }
>   ```
>
> - Output appears on the **serial monitor** in the Arduino IDE or PuTTY.
>
> **2. Remote Logging**
>
> - Instead of using a display, log data to a file or send it over **Wi-Fi, MQTT, or HTTP**.
>
> **3. JTAG Debugging**
>
> - JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) allows **hardware debugging** (used in ARM Cortex-based chips like STM32).
> - Requires an **external debugger** like the **Segger J-Link**.
> - Some has inbuilt JTAG.
> - unnecessary 
>
> **4. Use Emulators/Simulators**
>
> - Some IoT devices have emulators, such as:
>   - **QEMU** (for ARM Cortex IoT devices).
>   - **ESP-IDF simulator** (for ESP32).
>   - **Arduino Serial Plotter** (for sensor data visualization).

## Main Loop

> #### Supports Async & non blocking behavior

- IoT applications often require **low-latency responses** to external events. This demands asynchronous, non-blocking design patterns to avoid delays and maintain efficiency.

  

#### 1. **Interrupt Callbacks**

- The **runtime framework** monitors the environment (e.g., GPIO pins, sensor triggers).
- When an event occurs, it **automatically calls a specific function** in your code.
- 🟡 **Important:** Your callback function should execute **quickly**, avoiding long operations that may block other interrupts.
- <img src="./assets/image-20250409120715959.png" alt="image-20250409120715959" style="zoom: 67%;" />

#### 2. **Timer Interrupts**

- The **runtime framework** triggers a callback function at **regular intervals** using a **hardware timer**.
- You can use this to **poll sensors or inputs** periodically.
- Useful when events happen at known or fixed time intervals.

#### 3. **Timer Functions (Non-blocking Timers)**

- The **runtime** maintains a **software-based non-blocking timer**.
- Your main loop must check if the timer has elapsed (e.g., using `millis()` or similar).
- Helps perform actions **periodically** without blocking the main loop.

#### 4. **Native Management**

- No built-in support from the runtime for async behavior.
- You must **manually monitor** inputs, timers, or other asynchronous sources.
- All logic for event detection and response is implemented in your main loop.

> 1. **Interrupt Callback – "Tap on the Shoulder"**
>
> Imagine your robot is playing a game, and someone taps it on the shoulder to say, “Hey! Look, a button was pressed!”

>
> 👉 Here, **you’re not using an alarm** — your robot just **keeps checking the time** to decide when to do something.
>
> ------
>
> 4. **Native Management – "Always Be Watching"**
>
> This time, you say:
>  “Just keep watching the sensors and decide what to do all by yourself.”
>
> - The robot is **constantly looking around**, checking if something changed.
