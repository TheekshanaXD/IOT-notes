### **1. General-Purpose Computers (PCs)**

PCs are designed for a wide range of tasks, such as software development, gaming, browsing, and multimedia processing. Their architecture is more complex to support multi-tasking and a variety of applications.

**PC Software and System Components:**

- **Application Software:** Runs user applications like browsers, word processors, games, and development tools.
- **Common Runtime Environment:** Supports virtual environments and desktop interfaces (e.g., Windows Explorer, macOS GUI).
- **Operating System (OS):** Handles task management, memory allocation, security, and hardware abstraction. Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **BIOS/Firmware (Basic Input/Output System):** Initializes hardware at startup and loads the OS. Helps to get rid of the difficulty of managing hardware.
- **Hardware:** Includes CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, motherboard, and peripherals.

**Key Characteristics of PCs:**

 âœ” Designed for versatility and high performance.
 âœ” Multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities.
 âœ” High processing power, memory, and storage.
 âœ” Supports heavy applications like video editing and AI modeling.

------

### **2. IoT Devices (Internet of Things)**

IoT devices are designed for specific tasks like sensor data collection, automation, and real-time operations. They operate with minimal resources and often rely on wireless communication.

**IoT Software and System Components:**

- **Application Software:** Runs lightweight programs for data collection, processing, and automation (e.g., temperature monitoring, smart locks, fitness trackers).

- **Device Libraries:** Pre-compiled code to interact with hardware (e.g., sensor drivers, communication protocols like MQTT).
  <img src="./images/image-20250304043441294.png" alt="image-20250304043441294" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- **Basic Runtime Framework:** Instead of a full OS, many IoT devices use real-time operating systems (RTOS) or firmware-based execution to manage tasks efficiently. ==This will not manage the hardware. This will only help to start the program==.

  In IoT devices, a **Basic Runtime Framework** is a lightweight software layer responsible for managing the execution of programs, handling hardware interactions, and sometimes providing minimal scheduling and memory management. It is **much simpler than a full operating system** but still offers essential functionalities for embedded systems.
  

- **Hardware:** Typically includes microcontrollers (MCUs), sensors, network modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), and actuators.

**Key Characteristics of IoT Devices:**

 âœ” Optimized for low power consumption and efficiency.
 âœ” Designed for real-time operations with minimal latency.
 âœ” Often lacks a full OS (uses firmware or RTOS).
 âœ” Smaller storage and computing power compared to PCs.
 âœ” Connects to the cloud or other devices for data exchange.

## Hardware and software interactions

![image-20250304043704870](./images/image-20250304043704870.png)

------

### **1. General-Purpose Software (PCs)**

- Hardware is **abstracted** by the **Operating System (OS)** and **firmware**.
- Provides a **virtual environment** for programmers, making hardware details invisible.
- Programs interact with "virtual" devices using high-level commands:
  - Sending an **MQTT message** without worrying about the network type.
  - Reading ASCII input from the keyboard **without knowing the keyboard layout**.
  - Printing text **without handling screen resolution**.
  - Opening files **without knowing their exact location on the disk**.

> #### ðŸ”¹ **Key Benefit**: Developers donâ€™t need to worry about hardware detailsâ€”everything is managed by the 	  OS.

------

### **2. IoT Device Software**

- The program must manage **hardware directly**, using **low-level commands** such as:
  - **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output):** To control specific device ports.
  - **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) / DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** For analog signal processing.
  - **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):** Used to control motors, LEDs, etc.
  - **I/O Protocols (SPI, I2C, UART):** Used for **sensor communication**.
  - **Memory and Flash Management:** No virtual memoryâ€”programmers must manage storage efficiently.
- **Application software must manually handle resources**: ==sometimes with the help from a pre-written library==
  - **MQTT communication**: You need to **manually check connectivity** before sending messages.
  - **Keyboard input processing**: Raw key-switch data must be **translated into ASCII codes**.
  - **I/O operations depend on the hardware**: Unlike PCs, where printing text is abstracted, IoT devices require **specific configurations**.

> #### ðŸ”¹ **Key Challenge**: IoT developers must directly interact with hardware, requiring more **low-level                ** programming and **manual resource management**.

### 3. Key differences 

| Feature                    | General-Purpose Software (PCs)         | IoT Device Software                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Abstraction**   | OS manages hardware                    | Programmer manages hardware                 |
| **Programming Complexity** | High-level APIs simplify development   | Requires direct hardware control            |
| **Device Communication**   | Automatically handled                  | Needs manual configuration (SPI, I2C, UART) |
| **Memory Management**      | Virtual memory and OS-level management | Manual memory and flash storage management  |
| **Ease of Use**            | Easier for developers                  | Requires embedded programming knowledge     |

- **PC software is user-friendly** because the OS abstracts hardware complexities.
- **IoT software requires low-level programming** because the developer must manually control hardware.
- If you're working with IoT, youâ€™ll often **write C or Python** for microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32, Raspberry Pi, etc.) and use **protocols like MQTT, I2C, and SPI**.

Cross platform development

#### **1. Development on a PC (Traditional Software Development)**

- Everything happens in **one environment** (coding, compiling, testing, and execution).

- Advanced debugging tools

   available:

  - **Breakpoints & stepping through code**: Allows developers to pause execution and inspect variables.
  - **Debug outputs (print statements)**: Easy to track program flow.
  - **Logging console**: Collects real-time logs for troubleshooting.
  - **Test scripts**: Automate testing.

âœ… **Why itâ€™s easy?**
 Because the **development environment and execution environment are the same**.

------

#### **2. Development on IoT Devices (Embedded Systems)**

- Development & execution occur in different environments :
  - Code is written & compiled on a PC (cross-compilation).
  - The compiled binary is deployed to the **IoT device** (like an ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or STM32).

**Challenges in IoT Development**

1. **Limited debugging tools**:
   - **No display** for direct debug output.
   - **No breakpoints or real-time stepping** (like in PC-based debugging).
   - Debugging often requires **external hardware tools** (e.g., JTAG, logic probes).
2. **Monitoring difficulties**:
   - Unlike a PC, where errors and logs appear in a console, IoT devices might require **serial debugging (UART/USB)** or logging to external files.
   - Some IoT devices have **real-time constraints**, making debugging harder.
3. **Hardware-dependent debugging**:
   - Debugging might need **oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or JTAG programmers**.
   - Debugging in low-power or networked IoT systems often requires **remote logging mechanisms**.

<u>**How to Debug IoT Devices Efficiently?</u>**

Here are **some workarounds** to make debugging easier in IoT projects:

**1. Serial Debugging (UART)**

- Most microcontrollers (ESP32, Arduino, STM32, etc.) support **UART-based debugging**.

- Example for ESP32 using Serial Monitor:

  ```cpp
  void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);  // Start serial communication
      Serial.println("Device Started!");
  }
  
  void loop() {
      Serial.println("Reading sensor data...");
      delay(1000);
  }
  ```

- Output appears on the **serial monitor** in the Arduino IDE or PuTTY.

**2. Remote Logging**

- Instead of using a display, log data to a file or send it over **Wi-Fi, MQTT, or HTTP**.

**3. JTAG Debugging**

- JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) allows **hardware debugging** (used in ARM Cortex-based chips like STM32).
- Requires an **external debugger** like the **Segger J-Link**.

**4. Use Emulators/Simulators**

- Some IoT devices have emulators, such as:
  - **QEMU** (for ARM Cortex IoT devices).
  - **ESP-IDF simulator** (for ESP32).
  - **Arduino Serial Plotter** (for sensor data visualization).

- IoT devices have limited processing power and memory, so programming languages must be optimized for small footprints.
- The code should be simple, fast, and consume minimal system resources to ensure smooth performance on embedded systems.

2. **Embeddable**

- IoT programming languages should integrate well with other environments, such as firmware or real-time operating systems.
- They should allow low-level hardware access for controlling sensors, actuators, and communication modules.

3. **Event-Driven Focus**

- IoT systems often rely on asynchronous event handling, where the system responds to external triggers like sensor inputs, network signals, or user commands.
- Features like timers, callbacks, and interrupt handling make the system responsive and efficient.

4. **Extensible**

- Modular programming allows flexibility in adding new features or integrating with third-party libraries.
- It supports different applications, from executing machine code on microcontrollers to running configuration scripts on cloud-connected devices.

5. **High-Level Abstractions**

- A good IoT language provides a simple and maintainable syntax while supporting multiple programming paradigms:
  - **Procedural** (structured step-by-step execution)
  - **Functional** (stateless, reusable functions)
  - **Data-flow** (event-based or stream processing)
  - **Object-oriented** (modular and reusable components)
- These abstractions improve code readability and scalability, making development easier.
